<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is implementing my own version of enumerable methods 

### Objective
 1. Getting better understanding of blocks procs and yield
 2. checking the inner of the Ruby enumerable methods that there is no big magic in it
 
### Assignment:
 

 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_each, a method that is identical to #each but (obviously) does not use #each. You’ll need to remember the yield statement. Make sure it returns the same thing as #each as well.
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_each_with_index in the same way.
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_select in the same way, though you may use #my_each in your definition (but not #each).
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_all? (continue as above)
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_any?
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_none?
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_count
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_map
 *  <strong>Create</strong> #my_inject

### Built With
This project was built using raw Ruby. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Use
Code in m_enumerables.rb, can be tested via console, adding the pertinent test cases on the file provided with said name. You are encourage to change the syntax of test cases and try with different combinations to properly test each algorithm.
<strong>PLEASE</strong> provide an example of test cases used if you found an error, or a slightly detailed explanation on why any method, line or sentence is wrong.
